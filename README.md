# Welcome to DHRI@SMU 2020 !

## Before DHRI begins, please do the following
### Zoom
* We will be using [Zoom](https://www.smu.edu/OIT/services/zoom) for discussion.
    * If you have not used Zoom before, please make an [appointment with Rafia](https://libcal.smu.edu/appointments/?g=2334) before DHRI to become familiar with Zoom.  
    * discuss breakout room
### Slack
* As we are working to build a community of practice, we are exploring multipe ways of communication. For this institute, we will be using Slack as an additional asynchronous communication method during the institute.
* [How the Digital Humanities are using Slack to support and build a geographically dispersed intellectual community](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2016/07/13/using-slack-to-support-a-geographically-dispersed-community/)
* [Install Slack](https://slack.com/get-started)

* Join the already established channel of DHRI@SMU 

### Optional 
* The following links are designed to ensure that all incoming participants have a familiarity with core concepts in how computers and the internet work. They will introduce terms such as input, output, storage, CPU, hardware, software, bits, circuits, and the operating system, as well as wired, cables, WiFi, packets, DNS, IP addresses, packets and routing, HTTP and HTML, encryption, public keys, and how search works. The skills workshops will begin with an assumption that you are at least familiar with these concepts and terminology.

## Required before session
**Read the following post and watch the video before this session.**
* ***[How Did They Make That? by Miriam Posner](https://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that/)***
*  ***[How Did They Make That? The Video!by Miriam Posner](http://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that-the-video/)*** 
* *Keep the following questions in mind. We will be discussing these texts in our first session*
   * How does this related to DH projects that you have thought about as a model or template for your work?  
   * What affordances and limitations are discussed?  
   * What constraints did they operate under? 
   * What was the original research question? 
   * How did it change as the project was worked on? Whose labor was necessary for the project to be successful?  
   * Which of those are made visible or acknowledged in the final output/publications? 
   * How does that effect your perception of those projects? 

# Introduction to DHRI@SMU 2020
As part of our welcome process, we’ll provide some of the history of the project, review the schedule, establish the objectives for the Institute, and ask participants to engage in introductions and an ice breaker activity. We’ll review the objectives and the schedule for the next few days, sort out pedagogical practices, and set our ambitious course for our time together. Everything we do throughout the institute is collaborative and community-driven. 

## Goals for DHRI
* An understanding of the importance of community in Digital Humanities and how that might differ from other types of scholarly communities.
* An understanding that Communities of Practice are the structure of this workshop series, which means working together to improve everyone’s learning.
* Acknowledging that Digital Humanities is inherently interdisciplinary and collaborative; by participating in activities with their fellow attendees, they will simulate the work done by digital humanists.
* Creating a personal definition of DH that is useful for the individual's work. This is essential because DH is so many things -- what definition is useful for their research and scholarship?  
* Learning how to read a 'bibliography' of a DH project to see what went into it (about page).
* Articulating more sophisticated questions about DH than previously.

By the end of the week, attendees will not be digital humanities experts, but they will be on their way to becoming full participants in a digital humanities community.
