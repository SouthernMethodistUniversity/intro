# Welcome to DHRI@SMU 2020 !

## Before DHRI begins, please do the following
* We will be using [Zoom](https://www.smu.edu/OIT/services/zoom) for discussion.
    * If you have not used Zoom before, please make an [appointment with Rafia](https://libcal.smu.edu/appointments/?g=2334) before DHRI to become familier with Zoom.  

### Optional 
* The following links are designed to ensure that all incoming participants have a familiarity with core concepts in how computers and the internet work. They will introduce terms such as input, output, storage, CPU, hardware, software, bits, circuits, and the operating system, as well as wired, cables, wifi, packets, DNS, IP addresses, packets and routing, HTTP and HTML, encryption, public keys, and how search works. The skills workshops will begin with an assumption that you are at least familiar with these concepts and terminology.

# Introduction to DHRI@SMU 2020
As part of our welcome process, we’ll provide some of the history of the project, review the schedule,establish the objectives for the Institute, and ask participants to engage in an introductions and ice breaker activity. We’ll review the objectives and the schedule for the next few days, sort out pedagogical practices, and set our ambitious course for our time together. Everything we do throughout the institute is collaboratively and community-driven. 

## Goals for DHRI
* An understanding of the importance of community in Digital Humanities and how that might differ from other types of scholarly communities.
* An understanding that Communities of Practice are the structure of this workshop series and means working together to improve everyone’s learning.
* Digital Humanities is inherently interdisciplinary and collaborative, by participating in the activities with their fellow attendees they will simulate the work done by digital humanists.
* Attendees should come to understand how to define DH (in a way that is useful for them). This is essential because DH is so many things, what definition is useful for their research and scholarship.  
* Learn how to read 'bibliography' of a DH project to see what went into it (about page)
* Attendees can articulate more sophisticated questions than previous.
* By the end of the week they will not be digital humanities experts but they will be on their way to become full participants in a digital humanities community.
