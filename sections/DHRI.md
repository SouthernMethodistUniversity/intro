# DHRI philosophy 

DHRI emphasizes foundational skills because we believe that it is the most effective path toward enabling digital humanities researchers to become self-teachers and mentors in their own right. Many bootcamp-style intensives prioritize instrumental outcomes, such as whether students can “write a for loop” or create a website. While these results are desirable, we find that students who know how to use the command line, read technical documentation, and reason about systems are more self-sufficient and better prepared to approach technology (and technical rhetoric) with a critical eye. This leads to second-and third-order effects as students teach themselves and teach others, and also provides a common conceptual vocabulary and skill set that serves as a basis for forming strong collaborations in the future. 

## DHRI structure 
* "Three structural elements are important for an effective DRI session: scoping, scaffolding, and purpose. Scoping is the art of choosing what—and especially what not—to include in a session. Scaffolding is the process of building later skill development on prior skill development. Purpose provides an answer to the participant who asks, "Why should I care about this?"

### Pedagogical approach
"The DHRI curriculum places great emphasis on foundational technical skills, and roughly one-third of all sessions at the Institute could be described as foundational. ... The difference between an instrumental approach and a foundational approach is often not immediately appreciated by participants, but over time they begin to change their minds. Although an instrumental approach satisfies a researcher’s most immediate need, a foundational approach takes into consideration the long term impact that learning core skills will have for the future professional and research needs of the scholar." [DHRI: Notes toward our pedagogical approach by Lisa Rhody, June 17, 2019](https://www.lisarhody.com/dhri-notes-toward-our-pedagogical-approach/)

### What affordances a foundational approach gives us
* There is a lot that personal computers allow us to take for granted when we do our work; however, knowing fundamentals can help humanities scholars become more confident users and critics of digital technologies. 
* Such knowledge leads not only to becoming a better self-teacher, but to more reflective and informed technology choices. It allows us to save time in creating projects when we know what a well-formed dataset should or could look like, when we know what the difference is between using proprietary software rather than open source, and what kind of support might be needed as projects grow. 

### Why use Communities of Practice (CoP) set up?

1. CoP is the structure of this workshop series 
2. CoP means working together to improve everyone’s learning.
3. By participating in the activities with their fellow attendees they will simulate the work done by digital humanists


# The pedagogical logics of each workshop session, and how we expect them to build on each other 

* DHRIs' goal is to create pipeline, so you know what next steps you want to take or what partners you want to seek out. there is a focus on foundational understanding, so you know what questions you want to ask. 
What are the fundamental conceptual understandings/frameworks needed for: Computational thinking? Humanities thinking? Computation humanities/digital humanities? Collaborative work in the Humanities/ Interdisciplinary work?

    * What does each workshop do? How does the next one build on it?

    TO BE UPDATED

* ***Introductions to communities of practice and what is Digital Humanities?*** How do you determine what kinds of DH you want to do, and what skills does that type of DH require in terms of your skill building *or* what partners do you then need to seek out. No DH project is an island! (unless maybe it is a veeeeeeery small island) 

* ***Introductions to communities of practice and what is Digital Humanities?*** How do you determine what kinds of DH you want to do, and what skills does that type of DH require in terms of your skill building *or* what partners do you then need to seek out. No DH project is an island! (unless maybe it is a veeeeeeery small island) 

* **Command line is to understand the structure of computers and their logic.** Introduces conceptualization/ helps to understand directory structure. Helps understand how scripts work, so when you set up tools in the future, you can set them up to be useful for what you are trying to do. The goal is that when you are setting up environments in something like Rstudio (and it asks you about regrex),you can make informed choices about the settings. 

* **Git is the logic of versioning of collaborative works** as programmers do it, so you can not worry about losing data, collaborative works (coding). 

* **HPC and Python is ........** UPDATE.  

* **Data literacies** ["Data literacy includes statistical literacy but also understanding how to work with large data sets, how they were produced, how to connect various data sets and how to interpret them.”](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/understanding_data_0.html). When we talk about data in the humanities, what do we mean? Big? Smart? Clean? Messy? 
 
    * **Tools** Understanding what data you need and what you want to do with that allows you to determine if you need a specifc script/library package or if you can use a DH tool for your specfic question. 
        *  When a tool or program (such as even Zotero, Voyant) asks you to set up an environemnt or choose specific setting you are making choices that will shape your results. 
        *  When you are setting up your tools, questions are being asked that will shape the answers/results you get. If the sert up questions don't make sense, you will have a better sense of what expertise you want to seek out to help you choose. 

    * Note: Skill in programming or tools only grows when you are using them to complete a project (skill building is usually project-based).

* To build a complete project/expertise is beyond the scope of this institute, but we want to help you build the foundation, and perhaps even an outline of your goal.  We want to help you get to a point where you are comfortable figuring it out (stack exchange) or you know when you have a question, how to phrase it and find the expertise you want to draw upon (community of practice) 

* In the closing **Project Lab** we will work on applying what we have discussed  to your specific research data/questions.
