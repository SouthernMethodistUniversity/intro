# How did they do that? 

* "Many students tell me that in order to get started with digital humanities, they’d like to have some idea of what they might do and what technical skills they might need in order to do it." [by Miriam Posner](http://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that/)

* We will be basing in session discussion around the following posts. **Read the following post and watch the video before this session.**
* ***[How Did They Make That? by Miriam Posner](https://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that/)***

## Computational & humanities thinking: “How did they do that”
* Determining *how* to ask questions: What questions you can ask?
* Not providing answers, but generative questions: *How* did they do that? *Why* did they do it that way? 
* Tool-based vs. foundations approaches
* Asking questions and avoiding the curse of knowledge. 
    * ["Curse of knowledge is a cognitive bias that occurs when an individual, communicating with other individuals, unknowingly assumes that the others have the background to understand."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge)
* How to build bridges, not walled gardens 

### How do you read a project to see what went into it?
Like reading a bibliography:
* How many articles are listed? 
* How many people? Who is given attribution? 	
* Credits at the end of a movie 
* Affordances & limitations 

**Exercise: Take existing models and adapt it to your field. (What are some examples? How does it apply to your field?)**

* Break it down into steps.
* Imagine hypothetical projects (wireframing with no knowledge).
* What expertise is needed? Individual expertise may vary.
* What resources are needed?
* What questions are you trying to ask or answer?
    * This is meant to be generative.

#### System thinking: About affordances and limitations.
* Focus on what is being hidden from you.
    * What are the differences between different citations managers: Refworks vs. Zotero?
* Precision/control vs ease of use.
* What ***affordances & limitations*** are offered in each path?

# How do you do that? How do we do that?
* You're not going to be good at everything. What is your area of focus, and what do you know you need help with?
* [Legitimate Peripheral Practitioner (LPP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimate_peripheral_participation) 
* "I think that we rarely acknowledge another idea of what a DH project is, and the point of starting one: *it’s a demonstration that you are actively participating and contributing to one or more communities, shaping and being shaped by them.* Keeping that idea in mind can help ground your perspective as you proceed and allow you to avoid being overly focused on the idea of whether your project will or won’t succeed."

## Values & Ethics
[Repository: Ethics for Digital Projects and Research](https://github.com/DHRISMU/ethics)
[Activity](https://github.com/DHRISMU/ethics/blob/master/sections/beyond.md#activity)

## Labor & Attribution 
* [Collaborators’ Bill of Rights](http://mcpress.media-commons.org/offthetracks/part-one-models-for-collaboration-career-paths-acquiring-institutional-support-and-transformation-in-the-field/a-collaboration/collaborators%E2%80%99-bill-of-rights/)

"All kinds of work on a project are equally deserving of credit (though the amount of work and expression of credit may differ). And all collaborators should be empowered to take credit for their work." 

* [A Student Collaborators’ Bill of Rights](https://humtech.ucla.edu/news/a-student-collaborators-bill-of-rights/)

"Collaborations between students and more experienced digital humanities practitioners should benefit everyone." 

## Group work & project planning

#### Project Planning Models 

* [Project Charter](https://stewartvarner.com/2014/05/project-charter/) 
* [MOU](https://rc.library.uta.edu/uta-ir/handle/10106/25646)
* PMP: [Project Management Office (PMO) @SMU](https://www.smu.edu/OIT/Governance)

***Recurring questions to keep in mind: What are the affordances of choosing this path? What are the limitations?*** 

* You can use a project charter as a lightweight example of collaborative brainstorming and documentation.
