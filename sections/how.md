# How did they do that? 

* "Many students tell me that in order to get started with digital humanities, they’d like to have some idea of what they might do and what technical skills they might need in order to do it." [by Miriam Posner](http://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that/)

* We will be basing in session discussion around the following posts. **Read the following post and watch the video before this session.**

## Computational & humanities thinking “how did they do that”
* How to ask questions? What questions you can ask?

* Not providing answers, but generative questions? How did they do that? Why did they do it that way? 
* Tool based vs foundations approach 
* (questions, avoid curse of knowledge) 
* How to build Bridges, not walled gardens 

### How do you read a project to see what went into it?
Like reading a bibliography
* How many articles listed? 
* How many people? Who is given attribution? 	
* Credits at the end of the movie 
* Affordances & limitations 

**Exercise: Taking existing models and adapting it to your field (what are some examples? How does it apply to your field?)**

* Breaking Down into steps.
* Imagining hypothetical projects (wireframing with no knowledge).
* What expertise is needed? Individual expertise may vary.
* What resources are needed?
* What questions are you trying to ask or answer?
*   This is meant to be generative

#### System thinking: about affordances and limitations.
* Focus on what is being hidden from you.
*   What are the differences between different citations managers: Refworks vs Zotero?
* Precision/control vs ease of use.
* What ***affordances & limitations*** does each path offer?

# How do you do that? How do we do that?
* Not going to be good at everything, what is your area of focus, and what do you know you need help with?
* [Legitimate Peripheral Practitioner (LPP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimate_peripheral_participation) – Apprentice models.
* Becoming skillful and identity are the same process.

## Values & Ethics
[Repository: Ethics for Digital Projects and Research](https://github.com/DHRISMU/ethics)
[Activity](https://github.com/DHRISMU/ethics/blob/master/sections/beyond.md#activity)

## Labor & Attribution 
* [Collaborators’ Bill of Rights](http://mcpress.media-commons.org/offthetracks/part-one-models-for-collaboration-career-paths-acquiring-institutional-support-and-transformation-in-the-field/a-collaboration/collaborators%E2%80%99-bill-of-rights/)

"All kinds of work on a project are equally deserving of credit (though the amount of work and expression of credit may differ). And all collaborators should be empowered to take credit for their work." 

* [A Student Collaborators’ Bill of Rights](https://humtech.ucla.edu/news/a-student-collaborators-bill-of-rights/)

"Collaborations between students and more experienced digital humanities practitioners should benefit everyone." 

## Group work & Project planning

#### Project Planning Models 

* [Project Charter](https://stewartvarner.com/2014/05/project-charter/) 
* [MOU](https://rc.library.uta.edu/uta-ir/handle/10106/25646)
* PMP:[Project Management Office (PMO) @SMU](https://www.smu.edu/OIT/Governance)

***Reoccurring question to keep in mind: What are the affordances of choosing this path? What are the limitations?*** 

* You can use a project charter as a lightweight example of collaborative breainstorming and documentation.
