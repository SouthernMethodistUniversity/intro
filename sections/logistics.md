# Logistics:

### Our Zoom norms
* We want to encourage interaction, conversations and sense of community. Letâ€™s practice the following:
    * Keep cameras on 
    * Mute self when not talking
    * Make use of chat (email or Slack chat will be available for asynchronous conversations) 
* Each session will have a lead facilitator/instructor, but an additional facilitator will always be present and participating in chat.
