# Logistics:

## Location: Online (Zoom)

*  We will be using [Zoom](https://www.smu.edu/OIT/services/zoom) for discussion.
    * Discuss: How we will use breakout rooms
### Our Zoom norms
* We want to encourage interaction, conversations and sense of community. Letâ€™s practice the following:
    * Keep cameras on 
    * Mute self when not talking
    * Make use of Slack chat. We are using Slack, so that we can have asynchronous conversations.
* Each session will have a lead facilitator/instructor, but an additional facilitator will always be present and participating in chat on Slack.
