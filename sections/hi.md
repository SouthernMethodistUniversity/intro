* Introductions
    * What are participants' interests/areas of study?  
    * What are you interested in learning? 
    * What about DH is interesting to you?  
    * Do you have a research project in mind? 

*  Discussion of collaborative project experiences:  
    * Think of a group project you already have done in school/work. 
        * If it went well, what made it go well? 
        * If it went poorly, what made it go poorly? 
    * Affordances & limitations apply at every step; every time you make a choice, it precludes other options.
